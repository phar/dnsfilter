you dont want to use this.. trust me..

sudo python dnsfilter.py


https://localhost:5000/ to add/remove hosts.. i never bothered implementing removing hosts

there are no options.. there is no hope..

cp dnsfilter.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable dnsfilter
